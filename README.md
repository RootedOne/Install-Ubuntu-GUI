# How to Install GUI for Ubuntu

This guide will walk you through the steps to install a graphical user interface (GUI) on Ubuntu using the Xfce desktop environment and enable remote desktop access via XRDP.

## Installation Steps

1. Update the package list and install the required packages:

```
   apt update && apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies xrdp -y 
```
   - `apt update`: Updates the package list to ensure you have access to the latest versions of the packages.
   - `apt install`: Installs the specified packages.
     - `xfce4`: The core package for the Xfce desktop environment.
     - `xfce4-goodies`: Additional utilities and plugins for the Xfce desktop environment.
     - `xrdp`: A remote desktop protocol (RDP) server that allows remote access to the Ubuntu system.
   - `-y`: Automatically answers "yes" to any prompts during the installation process.

2. Set the default session for XRDP:
```
   echo "xfce4-session" | tee .xsession
```
   - `echo "xfce4-session"`: Outputs the string "xfce4-session".
   - `| tee .xsession`: Pipes the output of the previous command and saves it to a file named `.xsession`. This file is used by XRDP to start the Xfce session.

3. Restart the XRDP service to apply the changes:
```
   systemctl restart xrdp
```
   - `systemctl`: A command to manage system services.
   - `restart`: Restarts the specified service.
   - `xrdp`: The name of the XRDP service.

## Accessing the GUI

After completing the installation steps, you can access the Ubuntu system remotely using an RDP client. Use the following information to connect:

- IP address: The IP address of your Ubuntu system.
- Port: 3389 (default XRDP port)
- Username: Your Ubuntu username
- Password: Your Ubuntu password

Once connected, you will see the Xfce desktop environment, and you can interact with the Ubuntu system using the graphical interface.
